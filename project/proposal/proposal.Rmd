# Project goals
In light of political and public uproar regarding police-officers using deadly force towards members of the public, our group hopes to reduce these incidents by strengthening the Early Intervention System with machine learning algorithms. 

## Problem definition
The advent of social media has placed the actions of police officers under severe scrutiny. In recent years, there has been videos and pictures of police officers performing adverse actions to civilians circulating online. The circulations of these content has resulted in an incensed public and strained the relationship between the American police force and its civilians.  

## Importance and Impact
Since the goal of the police force is the ensure safety of the civilians, it is important to restore the trust between police and the general public so that the general public can feel "safe" again. 

## Who cares
The White House has placed public safety, law enforcement and community relations as one of its top priorities. This is evident from the Launch of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing by President Obama in 2015. The goal of the Task Force is to gain a better understanding of specific policing challenges and devise actionable plans to improve law enforcement and enhance community engagement. 

## Who will take action based on your work
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) will apply the machine learning algorithms we have devised to improve on their existing Early Intervention System. By detecting police officers at risk of adverse events prior to them committing the action, the CMPD can direct these officers to retraining programmes to extract them from high-stress environments, remind them the ethos of the CMPD and improve on their capacity to deal with such situations.

## What are the policy goals you care about?
Leveraging on a more data-driven approach in the Early Intervention System allows the department to better identify police officers at risk, increase internal accountability and reduce inappropriate uses of force. A tangible policy goal we would like achieve through this project is a safer public-facing CMPD, without compromising law enforcement. We also hope to achieve a more intangible goal: to ease the existing tensions and foster stronger trust between the community and the CMPD. 

# Data
The data consists of a detailed event record of each police officer and the officer's demographic information. This extensive dataset has been collected by the CMPD to manage their daily operations. 

# Analysis
We are looking to identify a risk ranking score that determines the probability that police officers will engage in adverse event/misconduct behavior^[We refer to adverse events or misconduct behavior for the following criteria: (1) officer's improper use of force, (2) citizen or officer injury or accident and (3) any sustained serious complaint from a citizen or colleague.]. As explained before, our predictors (features) will be **** from a time-period that will predict a risk ranking score which could be used, at different thresholds, to obtain a dummy output variable ${0,1}$ for a top-N list, that indicate if an officer is likely to misbehave in a period of time. 

As the previous section describes, our label (dependent variable) will be based on the 

For this endeavor, we will look to implement three different binary classification models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM's) and Random Forests. We expect to estimate the probability assigned to class $C_i$ from the three proposed models with distinct parameters settings. 

## What actions will this enable or improve?
The objective of police departments is to train and retain the very highest quality police force. As budget constraints exists, police officers need to train and mentor those that needed the most. In this sense, the objective is to better identify police officers that are riskier to misconduct. By the provision of a score (probability) to each police officer, we could rank police officers by the risk of adverse behavior controlling for precision-recall tradeoffs that can give more control and flexibility to police departments to make interventions such as training, counselling or mentorship that can improve their quality services to the society.
As there are limited resources to intervene all the police force, the ranking allows to the police department to adjust the risk threshold depending on their resources and their capacity to intervene police officers.

# Evaluation
We will train our data for a fixed period of time, 2013-2014, to test in 2015. As we expect that our class of interest is the minority class, accuracy and performance on the majority class are not the right metrics to optimize. For this reason, for assessing the classification performance, we will use precision (true negative rate), the proportion of actual positives among the predicted positives.^[Flach, Peter. Machine learning: the art and science of algorithms that make sense of data. Cambridge University Press, 2012]. We will evaluate the process with a 3-fold cross validation in order to compare the models.
