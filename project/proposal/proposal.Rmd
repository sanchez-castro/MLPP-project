# Analysis
We are looking to identify a risk ranking score that determines the probability that police officers will engage in adverse event/misconduct behavior^[We refer to adverse events or misconduct behavior for the following criteria: (1) officer's improper use of force, (2) citizen or officer injury or accident and (3) any sustained serious complaint from a citizen or colleague.]. As explained before, our predictors (features) will be **** from a time-period that will predict a risk ranking score which could be used, at different thresholds, to obtain a dummy output variable ${0,1}$ for a top-N list, that indicate if an officer is likely to misbehave in a period of time. 

As the previous section describes, our label (dependent variable) will be based on the 

For this endeavor, we will look to implement three different binary classification models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM's) and Random Forests. We expect to estimate the probability assigned to class $C_i$ from the three proposed models with distinct parameters settings. 

## What actions will this enable or improve?
The objective of police departments is to train and retain the very highest quality police force. As budget constraints exists, police officers need to train and mentor those that needed the most. In this sense, the objective is to better identify police officers that are riskier to misconduct. By the provision of a score (probability) to each police officer, we could rank police officers by the risk of adverse behavior controlling for precision-recall tradeoffs that can give more control and flexibility to police departments to make interventions such as training, counselling or mentorship that can improve their quality services to the society.
As there are limited resources to intervene all the police force, the ranking allows to the police department to adjust the risk threshold depending on their resources and their capacity to intervene police officers.

# Evaluation
We will train our data for a fixed period of time, 2013-2014, to test in 2015. As we expect that our class of interest is the minority class, accuracy and performance on the majority class are not the right metrics to optimize. For this reason, for assessing the classification performance, we will use precision (true negative rate), the proportion of actual positives among the predicted positives.^[Flach, Peter. Machine learning: the art and science of algorithms that make sense of data. Cambridge University Press, 2012]. We will evaluate the process with a 3-fold cross validation in order to compare the models.
